    <h2>The major Changes of CSS3</h2>
    <p>
        The first change which is introduced in CSS3 is the opacity property which allows us to specify the opacity of an element
        and any of its child elements.The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
        is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).The CSS3 rgba property allows us to specify a color,
        like we use for the RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity. This value is
        known as an alpha value. The rgba value will only affect the element on which it is applied
        (not child elements).But some browsers will not recognize RGBA colors,so we must offer a fallback so that they
        display a solid color. If there are two rules that apply to the same element, the latter of the two
        will take priority. To create the fallback, we can specify a color as a hex code, color name or
        RGB value, followed by the rule that specifies an RGBA value. If the browser understands RGBA colors it will use that rule. If it
        doesn't, it will use the RGB value. At the time of writing, the opacity and RGBA properties are only supported by the most
        recent browsers.

    <p>
        Another change which CSS3 introduces is an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using 
        hue, saturation, and lightness values. HUE is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
        saturation is expressed as a percentage. lightness is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal,
        and 100% being black.Lightness is the eeamount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness
        is represented as a percentage.0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness
        is sometimes referred to as luminosity. Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is
        represented as a percentage.100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
        Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle
        where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
    </p>
    <p>CSS3 has also introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders. and also we can create
        any rounded border box using the property border-radius. the value indicates the size of the border-radius
        in pixels. we can specify the individual values using border-top-right-radius,border-bottom-right-radius
        border-bottom-left-radius, border-top-left-radius.We can also use a shorthand of these four properties (in
        clockwise order: top, right,bottom, left). For example: border-radius: 10px, 5px,6px, 45px; there for
        using this property we can draw the eliptical shapes and rounded corners.

        <p>
            Yes it matters. we must choose the right relative units(%, em , rem) to create flexible and robust 
            designs in a straightforward manner.for example if we consider the browser zooming. When the user
             zooms the page in a modern browser, everything scales up — or down — proportionally, depending 
             on the user’s preference. That means our users/end users need to be able to zoom the viewport without 
             loss of content or functionality, or restrictions imposed by CSS values or viewport scaling settings.
             The page may zoom, however the fonts will not scale up relatively to the browser default font size setting. 
             Therefore, the end user experience is being impacted by the developer’s choice to use pixels for fonts.
             when does we use the pixels, em and rem? you can use <a href="http://www.standardista.com/px-to-rem-conversion-if-root-font-size-is-16px/">
                great px to rem conversion reference table</a> here or If you want an online calculator use this 
                <a href="http://pxtoem.com/">Pxtoem</a> . 
             => we didn't use em sometimes.for example, we quite often come into a problem with
              images, for example icons, but it can be whatever image. We want to set width using `em`s as well to 
              scale up with `font-size` of a link which the icon belongs to, but it renders blurry sometimes 
              because it computes to a value like 12.15245px. So we are forced to set it in pixel value so it is 
              not blurred but then it would not scale up when font-size through browser setting is increased/decreased
            => we use em when 
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-css3-values-20130730/#font-relative-lengths">W3C spec</a> the definition for one rem unit is:

Equal to the computed value of font-size on the root element. When 
specified on the font-size property of the root element, the rem units refer to the property’s initial value.

This means that 1rem equals the font size of the html element (which for
 most browsers has a default value of 16px).
 The main problem with em units is that they are relative to the font size of their
  own element. As such they can cascade and cause unexpected results. Let’s consider the 
  following example, where we want lists to have a font size of 12px,
  in the case where the root font size is the default 16px: Especially, if you're designing 
  for multiple resolutions with responsive design.
  Think of generally smaller or larger font sizes on mobile phones. 
  It takes time to recalculate every pixel value to the new base font size. 
  This is where relative font sizes become useful. With em/rem sizing, you can change 
  just the base font size for a specific viewport to decrease or increase all font sizes, 
  while keeping proportions between the different styles.
  This leads to problems, because it might become complex to know the 
  inherited font size from within the CSS. Here it comes to rem. The cool thing about this 
  CSS3 unit is, that it always uses the root (e.g. html) 
  font size as the base size instead of the inherited one. Therefore it is always calculable.
