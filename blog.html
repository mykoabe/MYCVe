    <h2>The major Changes of CSS3</h2>
    <p>
        The first change which is introduced in CSS3 is the opacity property which allows us to specify the opacity of an element
        and any of its child elements.The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
        is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).The CSS3 rgba property allows us to specify a color,
        like we use for the RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity. This value is
        known as an alpha value. The rgba value will only affect the element on which it is applied
        (not child elements).But some browsers will not recognize RGBA colors,so we must offer a fallback so that they
        display a solid color. If there are two rules that apply to the same element, the latter of the two
        will take priority. To create the fallback, we can specify a color as a hex code, color name or
        RGB value, followed by the rule that specifies an RGBA value. If the browser understands RGBA colors it will use that rule. If it
        doesn't, it will use the RGB value. At the time of writing, the opacity and RGBA properties are only supported by the most
        recent browsers.

    <p>
        Another change which CSS3 introduces is an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using 
        hue, saturation, and lightness values. HUE is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
        saturation is expressed as a percentage. lightness is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal,
        and 100% being black.Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness
        is represented as a percentage.0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness
        is sometimes referred to as luminosity. Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is
        represented as a percentage.100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
        Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle
        where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
    </p>
    <p>CSS3 has also introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders. and also we can create
        any rounded border box using the property border-radius. the value indicates the size of the border-radius
        in pixels. we can specify the individual values using border-top-right-radius,border-bottom-right-radius
        border-bottom-left-radius, border-top-left-radius.We can also use a shorthand of these four properties (in
        clockwise order: top, right,bottom, left). For example: border-radius: 10px, 5px,6px, 45px; there for
        using this property we can draw the eliptical shapes and rounded corners.

        <p>
            Yes it matters. we must choose the right relative units(%, em , rem) to create flexible and robust 
            designs in a straightforward manner.for example if we consider the browser zooming. When the user
             zooms the page in a modern browser, everything scales up — or down — proportionally, depending 
             on the user’s preference.
