    <h2>The major Changes of CSS3</h2>
    <p>
        The first change which is introduced in CSS3 is the opacity property which allows us to specify the opacity of an element
        and any of its child elements.The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
        is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).The CSS3 rgba property allows us to specify a color,
        like we use for the RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity. This value is
        known as an alpha value. The rgba value will only affect the element on which it is applied
        (not child elements).But some browsers will not recognize RGBA colors,so we must offer a fallback so that they
        display a solid color. If there are two rules that apply to the same element, the latter of the two
        will take priority. To create the fallback, we can specify a color as a hex code, color name or
        RGB value, followed by the rule that specifies an RGBA value. If the browser understands RGBA colors it will use that rule. If it
        doesn't, it will use the RGB value. At the time of writing, the opacity and RGBA properties are only supported by the most
        recent browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another change which CSS3 introduces is an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using 
        hue, saturation, and lightness values. HUE is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
        saturation is expressed as a percentage. lightness is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal,
        and 100% being black.Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness
        is represented as a percentage.0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness
        is sometimes referred to as luminosity. Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is
        represented as a percentage.100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
        Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle
        where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
    </p>
    <p>CSS3 has also introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders. and also we can create
        any rounded border box using the property border-radius. the value indicates the size of the border-radius
        in pixels. we can specify the individual values using border-top-right-radius,border-bottom-right-radius
        border-bottom-left-radius, border-top-left-radius.We can also use a shorthand of these four properties (in
        clockwise order: top, right,bottom, left). For example: border-radius: 10px, 5px,6px, 45px; there for
        using this property we can draw the eliptical shapes and rounded corners. For additional clarifications

    <div class="question_two"> 
        <h2>Does it matter using relative size(%,em,rem) on styling the size of an
            element so that the element is responsive?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes it matters. we must choose the right relative units(%, em , rem) to create flexible and robust 
            designs in a straightforward manner.for example if we consider the browser zooming. When the user
             zooms the page in a modern browser, everything scales up or down proportionally, depending 
             on the user’s preference. That means our users/end users need to be able to zoom the viewport without 
             loss of content or functionality, or restrictions imposed by CSS values or viewport scaling settings.
             The page may zoom, however the fonts will not scale up relatively to the browser default font size setting. 
             Therefore, the end user experience is being impacted by the developer’s choice to use pixels or relative units for fonts.
             we can use <a href="http://www.standardista.com/px-to-rem-conversion-if-root-font-size-is-16px/">
                great px to rem conversion reference table</a> here or If we want an online calculator use this 
                <a href="http://pxtoem.com/">Pxtoem</a> to change all conversion . 
            lets see one by one this the relative units and the pixels when we use and don't use.
             sometimes the web developer may come into a problem with
              images, for example icons, but it can be whatever image. he want to set width using `em`s as well to 
              scale up with `font-size` of a link which the icon belongs to, but it (the browser) renders blurry sometimes 
              because it computes to a value like 12.15245px. So we are forced to set it in pixel value so it is 
              not blurred but then it would not scale up when font-size through browser setting is increased/decreased
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-css3-values-20130730/#font-relative-lengths">W3C spec</a> 
            the definition for one rem unit is equal to the computed value of font-size on the root element. When 
            specified on the font-size property of the root element, the rem units refer to the property’s initial value.
            This means that 1rem equals the font size of the html element (which for most browsers has a default value of 16px).
            The main problem with em units is that they are relative to the font size of their own element. 
            As such they can cascade and cause unexpected results. Let’s consider the following example, where we 
            want lists to have a font size of 12px, in the case where the root font size is the default 16px: 
            Especially, if we're designing for multiple resolutions with responsive design. Think of generally 
            smaller or larger font sizes on mobile phones. It takes time to recalculate every pixel value to the new base font size. 
            This is where relative font sizes become useful. With %,em/rem sizing, we can change just the base font size for 
            <a href=""></a> specific viewport to decrease or increase all font sizes, 
            while keeping proportions between the different styles.   This leads to problems, because it might become complex to know the 
            inherited font size from within the CSS. Here it comes to rem. The cool thing about this 
            CSS3 unit is, that it always uses the root (e.g. html) font size as the base size instead of 
            the inherited one. Therefore it is always calculable. There for using the relative size matters 
            the browser zooming.

    <div class="question_two"> 
        <h2>We said 16px is default browser font size so what does it mean when we say
            200px ? How does the browser interprets that?</h2>
        <p> The browser has the default font size of 16px means all the contents inside the html page have the font 
            size of 16px or 1rem. but it doesn't include the header groups from h1 to h6. Generally according
            to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/font-size">font-size - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN</a>
            If we haven't set font size anywhere on the page, then it would be the browser default, 
            which is probably 16px. So by default 1rem = 16px. If we were to go and set a font-size 
            of 200px on the browser text, the value or the text becomes about 12.5 times of that of the
            default browser font size which is 16px or 1rem.
            </p>
            <p>But if we give the body about 16px or 1em, and we were to go and set a font-size 
                of 200px on the browser text the value will gove its value relativly the body of the 
                web page. </p>
